THIS IS A TEST BRANCH TO PORT THIS TO 1.20.6 EVERYTHING HERE IS EXPERIMENTAL EVEN IF IT SOMEHOW ISN'T BROKEN

a geyser-compatible datapack that adds (untested):

-custom mobs

-custom mob spawning

-a custom armor trim

-an armor trim detection system (half-broken)

-a time detection system (sorta)

-events that happen once a day

-a literal rng pool

-a lot of bugs

-many *many* performance issues

-loose files

-buged the bundle

-removed herobrine

in short: a lot of commands to try to recreate subnautica with some creative liberties (i've never played subnautica)

the geyser/bedrock files and java resource pack aren't included here (for now)

every file with .dis/.disabled/.old is eather a backup, 1.20.4 branch code or old code that's useless or unoptimized

i forgot to add the commands that set up the scoreboards on load.mcfunction, i'll do it eventually, so if you want to use this you're going to have to add them by hand (for now)
