a geyser-compatible datapack that adds:

-custom mobs

-custom mob spawning

-a custom armor trim

-an armor trim detection system

-a time detection system (sorta)

-events that happen once a day

-a literal rng pool

-a lot of bugs

-many *many* performance issues

-loose files

-added the bundle

-removed herobrine

in short: a lot of commands to try to recreate subnautica with some creative liberties (i've never seen subnautica)

the geyser/bedrock files and java resource pack aren't included here (for now)


i forgot to add the commands that set up the scoreboard on load.mcfunction, i'll do it eventually, so if you want to use this you're going to have to add them by hand (for now)
