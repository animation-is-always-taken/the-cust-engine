this is an experimental branch that will be merged with main as soon as everything is properly ported

this is a geyser-compatible datapack that adds:

-custom mobs

-custom mob spawning

-a custom armor trim

-an armor trim detection system (half-broken)

-a time detection system (sorta)

-events that happen once a day

-a literal rng pool

-a lot of bugs

-many *many* performance issues

-loose files

-buged the bundle

-removed herobrine

in short: a lot of commands to try to recreate subnautica with some creative liberties (i've never played subnautica)

the geyser/bedrock files and java resource pack are here https://github.com/animation-is-always-taken/cust-engine-extras

every file with .dis/.disabled/.old is eather a backup, 1.20.4 branch code or old code that's useless or unoptimized
